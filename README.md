# 100-days-of-machine-learning-from-scratch

This repository contains my 100-day learning journey in Machine Learning.
Every day, I will study one concept or algorithm and upload its implementation in Python.

Goals

Build strong fundamentals in Machine Learning

Practice coding algorithms from scratch

Maintain daily consistency

Create a portfolio for Data Science / ML roles

What you will find here

Daily folders (Day01, Day02, …)

Python code for each algorithm

Short explanations in README files

Small experiments and examples

Tools & Language

Python

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (when needed)

Progress

I will update this repository daily as part of my 100 Days of ML challenge.

Consistency over motivation. 🚀
